To create the dynamic Russian language learning platform, here’s how we can break it down step by step:

### Part 1: User Onboarding and Assessment
1. **User Questionnaire**:
   - Upon visiting the website, the user will be asked a series of questions to tailor the learning experience. Questions could include:
     - Do you have prior knowledge of Russian? (Yes/No)
     - What’s your goal? (e.g., Basic conversations, reading literature, etc.)
     - How much time can you dedicate daily? (e.g., 10 mins, 30 mins, 1 hour)
     - What’s your preferred learning style? (Reading, Writing, Listening, Speaking)

2. **Initial Module Creation**:
   - Based on the user’s answers, the system will generate a personalized learning path, starting from the basics if necessary.
   - The content should be divided into key pillars of language learning:
     - **Reading** (Learning the Cyrillic alphabet, pronunciation rules, basic grammar)
     - **Speaking** (Basic greetings, common phrases, phonetics)
     - **Listening/Understanding** (Listening to audio clips, short dialogues)
   
### Part 2: Structured Learning Path
1. **Chapters and Levels**:
   - Break down the language learning journey into **chapters** (e.g., Alphabet, Greetings, Numbers, Basic Grammar) and **levels** (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced).
   - For each chapter, include:
     - **Practice**: Exercises that reinforce concepts (fill-in-the-blanks, matching words, etc.)
     - **Revision**: Regular reviews after each chapter.
     - **Tests**: Short quizzes after every few chapters to test understanding.
     - **Progress Bar**: Visually display the user’s progress, encouraging them to move from basic to advanced.

2. **Dynamic Adjustments**:
   - Allow the system to dynamically adapt to the user’s progress. If a user performs well in a test, the next lesson can be slightly more advanced.
   - Include **optional lessons** for users who want to deep-dive into specific areas like Russian culture, slang, or idioms.

### Part 3: User Interactions and Feedback
1. **User Interaction**:
   - Implement a **chat feature** where users can practice Russian with each other.
   - Add **peer review** options where users can submit audio or written exercises and receive feedback from other learners or mentors.
   
2. **Community Building**:
   - Create **forums or discussion boards** where learners can share tips, ask questions, or discuss challenges.

3. **Future Updates**:
   - Keep the platform flexible for future updates, such as AI-based tutors, real-time conversations with native speakers, and more advanced testing methods.
