For the first phase of your Russian language learning platform, we'll focus on **user onboarding and assessment**. Here's how we can structure it:

### 1. User Onboarding Flow
The onboarding process needs to be simple, engaging, and informative, allowing the user to feel guided.

#### a. **Welcome Page**
- **Purpose**: Introduce users to the platform.
- **Design**: A clean, minimal page that explains the platform's purpose and how it works. Highlight that it’s free, adaptive, and will guide them from beginner to advanced.

#### b. **User Registration**
- **Fields**: Collect basic details like:
  - Name
  - Email (optional, if you plan to send progress reports or allow users to save their progress)
  - Password (optional, if user profiles are needed)
  - Language level (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced)
- If no registration is required, make it optional but offer a “continue as guest” option.

### 2. Assessment Questions
This part will personalize the learning experience by gathering key information:

#### a. **Prior Knowledge**
- **Question**: “Do you have any prior knowledge of Russian?”
  - If “Yes,” allow them to self-assess their level:
    - Beginner
    - Intermediate
    - Advanced
  - If “No,” the platform will automatically start them at the basics.

#### b. **Learning Goals**
- **Question**: “What’s your goal for learning Russian?”
  - Options: 
    - For travel
    - For work/studies
    - For social interaction
    - To read and write in Russian
  - Based on this answer, the platform can prioritize relevant chapters (e.g., practical phrases for travel or academic writing skills for work).

#### c. **Time Commitment**
- **Question**: “How much time can you spend learning each day?”
  - Options:
    - 10 minutes
    - 30 minutes
    - 1 hour or more
  - This will influence how long each learning module is and whether to offer frequent, short exercises or more in-depth lessons.

#### d. **Preferred Learning Style**
- **Question**: “How do you prefer to learn?”
  - Options:
    - Reading and writing
    - Listening and speaking
    - Interactive exercises
  - Based on their choice, the platform will offer more tailored content (e.g., audio lessons for listening, or more text-based content for reading).

### 3. Generating Learning Modules
After the assessment, the platform will generate the first set of modules based on the user’s answers:

#### a. **Initial Modules**
For a complete beginner, the first module might look like:
  - **Chapter 1**: Cyrillic Alphabet and Pronunciation
    - Introduction to Russian letters (with practice writing them)
    - Audio clips for pronunciation practice
  - **Chapter 2**: Basic Greetings and Introductions
    - Common greetings (audio + text)
    - Simple conversations (exercises to match the dialogue)
  - **Chapter 3**: Numbers and Days
    - Russian numbers (0-20)
    - Days of the week

#### b. **Progress Tracking**
- After each lesson, offer:
  - A **progress bar** to motivate users.
  - **Daily goals** (based on their selected time commitment).
  - Regular **revisions and quizzes** to reinforce learning.

### 4. Technical Design Considerations
- **Frontend**: Use a user-friendly design that works on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Backend**: Store user responses and create personalized learning paths dynamically. Use databases to track progress and allow users to revisit lessons or continue where they left off.
- **Adaptive Learning**: If the user is struggling, the system can slow down or add additional practice exercises. If they’re doing well, it can skip ahead to more advanced lessons.

### 5. Feedback and Testing
- After completing the first module, allow the user to **leave feedback** (optional).
- Offer an optional **test** to see if they’re ready to move forward or need more practice.
